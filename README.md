# Brain tumor classification with VGG16 and GradCAM++

## Overview
The project aims at **accurately identifying the presence of brain tumors in MRI** images. The project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically the **VGG16** convolutional neural network architecture, for image classification. To enhance interpretability and localize areas of interest in the MRI scans, **GradCAM++ (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is employed, providing visual explanations of the model's decisions.


## Features

- **Visualization with GradCAM:** This feature enhances interpretability by using GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to generate visual heatmaps. These heatmaps highlight the regions in MRI images that are critical for the model's tumor classification.

- **Multiple Image Processing:** Users can upload several images simultaneously, allowing for quick evaluation of multiple scans in one go.
